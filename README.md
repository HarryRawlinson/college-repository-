# Computer Programming Portfolio  
Harry Rawlinson – CS4C – Kazi

All the work in this repo is mine. AI declaration is filled in, academic honesty stuff read and understood.

Folder layout left exactly as it was given.

### Repo contents

- `/notebooks`  – every lab notebook from the semester data structures, functions, file I/O, argparse exercises, etc.  
- `/logbook`  – my 11 weeks of lecture notes, originally handwritten then converted to markdown.  
- `/project`  – Hollywood Hacker terminal hacking simulator  

### Project: Hollywood Hacker
Reads any text file and displays it in that typical nonesensical mission impossible hackerman style: 
character-by-character typewriter effect, fake network messages, random IPs, firewall bypass lines, payload injection, green text, dramatic pauses.  
Everything gets logged to `hacking_session.txt` at the end.  
Works properly on Windows, Mac and Linux, takes command-line arguments, handles errors cleanly.

Shows file handling, timing control, string manipulation, cross-platform code, argparse, etc.


### What I’ve learned this module
- Solid Python fundamentals (syntax, control flow, data structures)  
- File reading/writing and working with paths  
- Command-line arguments (sys.argv + argparse)  
- Proper Git workflow and meaningful commits  
- Structuring code with functions and keeping it readable  
- Debugging and testing systematically  
- Writing cross-platform terminal code

AI usage is fully documented in `AI_Declaration.md`. Used Copilot heavily and Claude/ChatGPT for occasional help, but all design decisions, logic and final implementation are my own.
