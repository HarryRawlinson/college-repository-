## notebooks

## What's in here:
- **00_warm_up.ipynb** - Initial Python exercises and getting comfortable with syntax
- **02_programs.ipynb** - Basic program structure and control flow
- **03_more_list_programs.ipynb** - List manipulation and iteration exercises
- **04_making_tables.ipynb** - Working with tabular data and formatting
- **05_tuples_happy_path.ipynb** - Tuple operations and immutable data structures
- **06_using_functions.ipynb** - Function design, parameters, and return values
- **07_data_structures.ipynb** - Advanced data structures (lists, dicts, sets)
- **08_file_wrangling.ipynb** - File I/O operations and handling different file types
- **09_command_line.ipynb** - Command-line arguments and sys.argv

## My experience:
I've had a lot of fun solving these programming questions and a lot of frustration debugging them too. Used Copilot quite a bit to help spot syntax errors and suggest what comes next, which really helped with learning the patterns.

These notebooks show my progression from basic Python concepts through to more advanced topics like file handling and command-line interfaces. They formed the foundation I built on for my final project.

Each notebook contains:
- Examples and exercises from lectures
- My own experiments and variations
- Comments explaining what I learned
- The occasional bug that took way too long to fix
