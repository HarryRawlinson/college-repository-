    "week 5 - 23rd october 2025 - bugs (and ducks)\n",
    "lecture about bugs and debugging and why everything is always broken\n",
    "\n",
    "what even is a bug\n",
    "a mistake in the code that makes the program do something weird or just crash\n",
    "basically impossible to prove a program has zero bugs\n",
    "you cant test every single possible situation ever\n",
    "like today im using my laptop and phone in a way no one in history has ever done exactly the same\n",
    "so yeah programs will always have bugs\n",
    "best we can do is be pretty confident it works most of the time\n",
    "\n",
    "two main types of errors\n",
    "syntax errors - code is straight up illegal python, wont even run (spelling mistakes basically)\n",
    "logic / semantic errors - code runs fine but does the wrong thing\n",
    "  two kinds of logic errors:\n",
    "  1. does what i wrote but i wrote the wrong thing (my fault)\n",
    "  2. does what i wrote but the task was specified wrong (not really my fault lol)\n",
    "\n",
    "bugs show up in two ways\n",
    "program looks fine but gives wrong answer sometimes\n",
    "program just crashes in some situations\n",
    "\n",
    "some errors are super rare so we dont bother handling them properly\n",
    "thats why windows gives you blue screen of death instead of something nice\n",
    "not worth the effort to handle every crazy edge case\n",
    "how to stop bugs happening so much\n",
    "linus's law - \"given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow\"\n",
    "code reviews\n",
    "no\n",
    " code goes into main without another human looking at it\n",
    "even the senior devs have to do it\n",
    "done with pull requests in git (branches → review → merge)\n",
    "\n",
    "pair programming\n",
    "two people one keyboard\n",
    "one types one thinks out loud\n",
    "basically nonstop code review\n",
    "part of extreme programming (xp)\n",
    "expensive but apparently really good for hard stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "technical debt\n",
    "when theres a quick dirty fix vs proper fix\n",
    "everyone picks the quick dirty one then cries later\n",
    "thats technical debt - you owe the code proper fix eventually\n",
    "\n",
    "how to actually find bugs (debugging)\n",
    "dry running - do it by hand on paper\n",
    "use the actual debugger in the ide - step line by line watch variables\n",
    "pepper with prints - just spam print() everywhere (fast and works surprisingly often\n",
    "problem is remembering to delete them after\n",
    "\n",
    "better prints - make a DEBUG = True at the top\n",
    "then if DEBUG: print(stuff)\n",
    "easy to turn off later\n",
    "\n",
    "logging - proper programs write everything to a log file\n",
    "can set levels (info warning error etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "walk away / coffee break\n",
    "your brain solves it when youre not looking at it\n",
    "loads of people have the 10 minute rule - if stuck longer go drink something\n",
    "\n",
    "explain to a friend\n",
    "half the time you spot the bug while explaining it\n",
    "\n",
    "rubber duck debugging (best one)\n",
    "explain the code line by line to a rubber duck on your desk\n",
    "you feel stupid but it actually works so well\n",
    "you realise the mistake while talking to the duck\n",
    "lecturer swears by this\n",
    "\n",
    "my thoughts\n",
    "kinda depressing that bugs are literally unavoidable\n",
    "but also kinda funny that talking to a duck is one of the best methods\n",
    "gonna buy a duck i think\n",
    "also feel better about doing code reviews now - thought it was just annoying but apparently\n"
