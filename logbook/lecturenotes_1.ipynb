    "1.Concerning programming \n",
    "\n",
    "what is programming?  \n",
    "\"Programming is the art of telling another human being what one wants the computer to do.\"\n",
    "Donald Knuth\n",
    "and how do we learn to program \n",
    "you cant learn how to program by reading books or watching videos or attending lectures\n",
    "you learn to program by writing code \n",
    "this is because programming is a skill\n",
    "videos can help you learn but youll only learn once you start writing code yourself and running into problems and solving them \n",
    "\n",
    "pragmatic programmer - good book to read on this subject \n",
    "\n",
    "what is a program ?\n",
    "a program is a set of instructions that a computer can understand and execute so solve a speciific problem or perform a specific task\n",
    "\n",
    "they are written in specified languages which is converted to machine code that the computer can understand\n",
    "and then once compiled the computer can execute the instructions step by step\n",
    "and produce the desired output\n",
    "programming languages can be understood by humans and are designed to be easy to read and write\n",
    "\n",
    "the 3 main parts of a program are \n",
    "sequence - the order in which instructions are executed \n",
    "selection - making decisions based on conditions\n",
    "iteration - repeating a set of instructions until a certain condition is met\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "READING INSTRUCTIONS \n",
    " instructions are read more than they are written \n",
    " in somethinking like a 10:1 ration or reading to writing \n",
    "code is read during code reviews debugging and maintenance\n",
    "    so writing code that is easy to read is very important\n",
    "\n",
    "reading a program can be easy even without fully understanding the language \n",
    "this is because programs follow a logical structure and use common programming constructs\n",
    "this is especially true for well written code which follows the best practices \n",
    "pep 8 is a good example of this for python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "writing a program is harder \n",
    "why?\n",
    "because it requires problem solving skills and creativity \n",
    "as well as not getting syntax or logical errors \n",
    "you must know the language \n",
    "\n",
    "you also need to know how to run the program and where to find the output and understnand it\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "you must be able to use computational thinking to break down problems into smaller parts\n",
    "\n",
    "you need to find errors in your code and solve them \n",
    "\n",
    "people become good programmers with practice and experience\n",
    "no shortcuts \n",
    "they may have encountered similar problems before or have a deep understanding of programming concepts and languages\n",
    "\n",
    "EXPERIENCE IS THE KEY TO PROGRAMMING!!! \n",
    "\n",
    "programmers arent better than junior programmers they are just faster at solving problems and have more experience\n",
    "                  |\n",
    "dont be this guy \\/ \n",
    " \"I'm finding it really difficult to help you here because you've made this much more complicated than it actually is. I recognise some of what you've done, but I really don't know where to start to unpick it.\"\n",
