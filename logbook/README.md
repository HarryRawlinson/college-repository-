# Logbook and Notes

This folder contains my notes and reflections on my progress throughout the programming module.

## What's in here:
- Weekly lecture notes (11 lectures covered)
- My evolving understanding of Python, Git, and VS Code
- Common programming practices I've learned
- Challenges I faced and how I solved them
- Development of my final project

## Note:
I didn't keep this as updated as I should have throughout the semester (wrote a lot on paper) but I've gone back and documented the key points from each lecture and my learning journey.
