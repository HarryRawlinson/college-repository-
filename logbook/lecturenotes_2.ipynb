    "LECTURE 2: PROGRAMING LANGUAGES \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "this lecture covers:\n",
    "a brief history of programming languages\n",
    "how has programming changed over time \n",
    "why we have different programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "\"we have to understand the past to understand the present\"\n",
    "Carl sagan\n",
    "\n",
    "why do we have computers ?\n",
    "computers are good at carrying out simple repetitive tasks quicker than a human could \n",
    "they cannot make mistakes the way a human can \n",
    "humans are good at solving complex problems although they are slower and more error-prone within repetitive tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "we also wanted an enviroment where we can input logic and the computer can execute it\n",
    "\n",
    "languages are a way for humans to communicate with computers\n",
    "early programming languages\n",
    "was low level machine code \n",
    "( no abstraction from hardware )\n",
    "\n",
    "the first examples of computers were large complex machines that were programmed using manual switches and patch cables\n",
    "which made programming tedious and error-prone especially mechanical errors\n",
    "\n",
    "the first computer programmer was a woman named ada lovelace\n",
    "she wrote an algorithm for charles babbage's analytical engine in the mid 1800s\n",
    "\n",
    "other important early figures in programming are alan turnig and john von neumann\n",
    "alan turing is considered the father of computer science\n",
    "hes most famous for cracking enigma \n",
    "being gay and then being castrated by the country he helped save.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "first generation programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "colossus was the first programmable digital computer it stil used plugs and switches to opperate \n",
    "\n",
    "in this time each computer had its own unique machine code \n",
    "so you had to know the low level language to begin to opperate \n",
    "\n",
    "second generation programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "programming then introduced assembly lnanguage \n",
    "they are stil low level and specific to cpu (no abstraction from hardware to hardware)\n",
    "\n",
    "third generation programming languages:\n",
    "these are finally getting to where the average person can understanda program just by looking at it youll find english words and functions rather than just 1s and 0s\n",
    "and the abillity to run the same code on multiple types of hardware (abstraction from hardware to hardware)\n",
    "examples of 3rd generation languages:\n",
    "fortran - scientific computing\n",
    "cobol - for business applications\n",
    "basic - beginners all\n",
    "\n",
    "if we never took this step we would have alot more barriers to running programs and we would care about what sort of cpu we have \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "third generation languages are also more specialised as mentioned above they are suited to different tasks \n",
    "\n",
    "c and c++ are also 3rd generation languages which are fast and can be applied more generally to projects \n",
    "\n",
    "since this we have essentially created programming languages for every task imaginable\n",
    "\n",
    "compilers and interpreters:\n",
    "there are 2 main ways to execute code written in high level languages\n",
    "\n",
    "compilers:\n",
    "a compiler translates the entire program into machine code before it is run thus creating a second .exe file for example \n",
    "these run faster since they are totally pre translated but require more space in memory and they take time to compile in the first place making development slower if the files are tested often \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "interpreters: \n",
    "interpreters translate and execute code line by line\n",
    "\n",
    "translation is faster than comipilation making development faster\n",
    "but execution is slower since each line must be translated before it is run\n",
    "\n",
    "c and c++ are compiled languages\n",
    "\n",
    "but \n",
    "python and javascript and php are interpreted languages\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "python is what we will be using in this course to start out with \n",
    "its a great one to learn early on since its syntax is simple and easy to read\n",
    "but it also allows for complex programs to be written\n",
    "its in the top 3 most popular programming languages in the world \n",
    "and there are many jobs that require python knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "python lacks memory effieciency and if it needs to run very quickly it may not be the best choice\n",
    "\n",
    "python is predicted to last a long time \n",
    "also like cobol which is still used in banking systems today even though its very old (1959)\n",
    "\n",
    "new languages take a long time to catch on Rust and Golang are newer and wil increase in usage over time\n",
    "\n",
    "while we have different programming languages they all share similar concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "sequential execution \n",
    "selection (if statements)\n",
    "iteration (loops)\n",
    "variables and data types\n",
