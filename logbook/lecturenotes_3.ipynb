    "Computers and instructions \n",
    "\n",
    "in this lecture we will explore basic programming ideas \n",
    "\n",
    "we will meet the python interactive interpreter \n",
    "\n",
    "why python ?\n",
    "python is a high level interpreted language that is more so used generally than for a specialised programming \n",
    "\n",
    "its good for developing quickly and experimenting \n",
    "\n",
    "python isnt great if a program needs to run very quickly as it needs alot of memory to run programs \n",
    "\n",
    "the python interpreter\n",
    "the interpreter is the program that will execute python code \n",
    "this can be done once we are finished programming or we can use it interactively \n",
    "\n",
    "we should really be calling python programs sripts and we should call python a scripting language rather than a programming language though neither is really wrong \n",
    "\n",
    "computers use buses to transfer instructions from memory ( machine code ) \n",
    "to the cpu which then processes these commands and then will then store other results in memory to be called later but also send outputs and recieve inputs from hardware \n",
    "\n",
    "abstraction:\n",
    "because python is a high level language to program with it we dont need to understand this process in too much detail \n",
    "but it is good to know this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers process values, stored in binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "These values are stored in the computer's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic operations are carried out in the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a small amount of memory in the CPU (in registers), with much more outside.\n",
    "For processing, values are copied to and from the CPU (which copying is slow).\n",
    "\n",
    "the python code we write when executed the cpu doesnt see the if statments our the prints the way we wrote the code they exclusively work with binary \n",
    "\n",
    "when a value is mentioned in a program \n",
    "the computer has to do a few steps to store it in memory \n",
    "it needs to remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "the datatype (integer)\n",
    "the characters (if it is a string )\n",
    "the value such as 42 if its a float or int \n",
    "these values need to be stored in a specific address so that we know where to look for them \n",
    "they are allocated memory according to the need to store the value \n",
    "\n",
    "bigger numbers = bigger memory required \n",
    "the name of the value is also stored and addressed and placed into a lookup table so the computer can search for this value later \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "it may look something like this \n",
    "Address\t    Value\t     Type\n",
    "0b101010\tint\n",
    "The denary value 42 is stored (in binary) in memory at address 0x00000001.\n",
    "\n",
    "we know that the variable spam is locatied at 0x00000001\t this address\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "so when this is used \n",
    "\n",
    "the name is located in the look up table and the value associated with the name can be called into output or input \n",
    "\n",
    "but not all values can work the same as integers ( althoughh boolean work similarly as they are represented as a 0 or 1 )\n",
    "\n",
    "but abstraction hides many of the individual differences to store other data types \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "some data is made up of smaller elements like letters in a string \n",
    "\n",
    "strings are stored in memory by storing the first char ( character ) in unicode \n",
    "as well as the next character and so on \n",
    "\n",
    "and a type of null character to show the end of the string \n",
    "as addresses like in realife are next to each other like houses on a street \n",
    "\n",
    "heres an example of a string being stored \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Address  \tValue\t        Type\n",
    "0x00000001\t0b01110011\tchar\n",
    "0x00000002\t0b01110000\tchar\n",
    "0x00000003\t0b01100001\tchar\n",
    "0x00000004\t0b01101101\tchar\n",
    "0x00000005\t0b00000000\tNone\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "THERE ARE LIMITATIONS THO \n",
    "\n",
    "the value of a integer is limited by the number of bits used to store one \n",
    "as are floats and the precision of the decimal place \n",
    "the length of a string is limited by the ammount of memory available \n",
    "\n",
    "although modern machines have gigbytes of memeory so this is rarely an isssue \n",
    "your not gonna worry about the size of a single string \n",
    "\n",
    "but processing a 1 gigabyte log file \n",
    "\n",
    "the cpus \n",
    "arithmetic logic unit haas to work very hard as it has to do all the mathmatical calculations to read the string and its addresses \n",
    "\n",
    "there are also other parts of the cpu that is important to this process \n",
    "the program control unit \n",
    "as it executes instructions and says what tasks to perform \n",
    "\n",
    "there are also registers with in the cpu addresses to store numbers for calculations \n",
    "\n",
    "program counters for example to show what has gone in and out \n",
    "\n",
    "the cpu has its own memeory too called cache \n",
    "this is a small amount of memory and is replaced often when it moves on to another task \n",
    "so its used frequantly during operaions to hold many different values and data although this is not where the program is stored \n",
    "\n",
    "this is stored in the main memory\n",
    "( there are many types of memory a story for another time )\n",
    "\n",
    "the pc keeps track of the address the program is stored at and the pc will cue up the addresses of the invidual instructiosn within the program \n",
    "\n",
    "the instructions will be in binary as i said earlier \n",
    "\n",
    "and they will go through many different processes and stages of being mathmatically manipulated by the alu \n",
    "although most alus in common cpu arcitecture can only do a few things to numbers \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you can only count, add two values, and negate one value. How can you do the following?\n",
    "\n",
    " Add two numbers together.\n",
    " Subtract one number from another.\n",
    " Multiply two numbers together.\n",
    " Divide one number by another.\n",
    "\n",
    " for instance comparing a number to 0 may sound like it cant be used for much but now you can determin if numbers are = \n",
    " or if one is less than \n",
    " or greater than another \n",
    " odd or even\n",
    "\n",
    "errors in programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "there are 2 different errors in programming syntax errors (spelling mistakes)\n",
    "\n",
    "or logical errors ( misspeaking)\n",
    "they are also callled semantic errors too \n",
    "\n",
    "it happens when the programs output is parcially unintended \n",
