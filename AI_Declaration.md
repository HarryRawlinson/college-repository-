# AI Declaration

I used AI a bunch this semester – mostly GitHub Copilot every single day and sometimes Claude or ChatGPT when I was proper stuck.

Copilot was just sat there suggesting code while I typed, fixing my dumb typos and reminding me how loops work at 3am. When something broke I’d paste the error into chatgpt and go “why is this dead” and it normally told me what was wrong. It also taught me real git commands because before this module I only knew the vscode buttons. Same with running python files from terminal with arguments – all from asking AI.

In notebooks copilot filled in the easy bits so I could keep going. READMEs and markdown got help to look decent. The fake classified file (target.txt with the big ASCII art) was 100% written by Claude – I literally just told it “make something that looks like a movie prop”.

Couple of logbook entries got tidied up by AI from my awful spelling.

But the actual Hollywood Hacker idea, the typewriter effect, random hacking messages, clearing the screen on windows AND linux, deciding the timing, adding the log file at the end – all that was me. I tested everything myself, tweaked sleeps till it felt right and I understand every line. Could rebuild the whole thing from scratch no problem.

Basically treated AI like a smarter version of stack overflow – quick hints and fixes, never just copied blind. Still learned proper python, argparse, file stuff, git, terminal colours, the lot.

So yeah the project is mine, AI just saved me from raging at missing colons.
